# Commentary-Generator-using-LLMs
Generating real-time sports commentary based on user input parameters using GPT-4
This project delves into how we can modernize the traditional way of writing commentary for every instance of sport. We are using the power of LLMs to generate real-time commentary for us based on given parameters by the user. This technique can be applicable to any sport. We need to customize the parameters that can capture the essence & dynamics of the game. For example in  football, relevant parameters could encompass Quarter, Time Remaining, Down, Yards to Go, Team on Offense, Team on Defense, Offensive Play Type, Defensive Play Type, Player with Ball, Target Player, Outcome, Yards Gained, Play Result etc
Here cricket is used to demonstrate my project.

Due to computational constraints, this research utilizes the GPT-4 API to integrate the sport-specific parameters and generate commentary.
I have trained the model by providing knowledge about the game type and demonstrated how I would like to view my output. I have also developed a custom UI using Streamlit asking the users to provide what the instance is about and we can be able to generate fresh commentary about it.

Other objective was to perform a simple sentiment analysis of past cricket commentary separately for batsman and bowler to understand the overall sentiment for each of them.
